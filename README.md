# My site with a collection of Web Dev Resources [![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

A curated list of guides, links, and experts that have helped me grow as a web developer.

This site is built using [Astro's Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) â€” a fast, minimal static site generator that's perfect for sharing valuable web development knowledge. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find resources covering everything from frontend fundamentals to advanced web techniques.
