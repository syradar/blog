### GitLab Handbook

> The handbook started when GitLab was a company of just ten people to make sharing information efficient and easy. We knew that future GitLab team-members wouldn’t be able to see emails about process changes that were being sent before they joined and that most of the people who would eventually join GitLab likely hadn’t even heard of us yet. The handbook was our way of ensuring that all of our company information was accessible to everyone regardless of when they became part of the team.
